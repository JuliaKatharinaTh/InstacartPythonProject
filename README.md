## üéØ Objective 
Instacart is an American company that operates as a same-day grocery delivery and pick-up service in the U.S. and Canada. It allows users to order groceries and other household items from participating retailers with the convenience of online shopping and have them delivered to their doorstep or prepared for pickup at the store. 

This project aims to assist Instacart with initial data and exploratory analysis to derive insights and recommend strategies for better segmentation.

## üìä Data
Utilizing open-source data sets from Instacart, including customer data and a data dictionary.

## üîß Tools
<ul><li>Python programming language</li></ul>
<ul><li>Jupyter notebooks</li></ul>
<ul><li>pandas</li></ul>
<ul><li>NumPy</li></ul>
<ul><li>matplotlib</li></ul>
<ul><li>scipy</li></ul>
<ul><li>seaborn</li></ul>

## üöÄ Executing the code
1. Install Anaconda, a package manager that includes Python and Jupyter Notebook
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook by opening a terminal or command prompt and typing jupyter notebook
3. Navigate to the directory where you have saved the project files
4. Open the Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files) containing the analysis by clicking on them
5. Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially by pressing Shift + Enter or by selecting 'Run All' from the 'Cell' menu

## ‚ùì Key Questions & Objectives

The project focuses on addressing key business questions posed by the Instacart Board, such as:

<ul><li>The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders</li></ul>
<ul><li>They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times</li></ul>
<ul><li>Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts</li></ul>
<ul><li>Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product orders</li></ul>
<ul><li>What‚Äôs the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how often do they return to Instacart)?</li></ul>
<ul><li>Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer‚Äôs loyalty status?</li></ul>
<ul><li>Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer‚Äôs region?</li></ul>
<ul><li>Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?</li></ul>
<ul><li>What different classifications does the demographic information suggest? Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?</li></ul>
<ul><li>What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer profiles? Consider the price of orders, the frequency of orders, the products customers are ordering, and anything else you can think of</li></ul>
